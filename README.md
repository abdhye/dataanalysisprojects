# dataanalysisprojects

Heyy, when I started learning Data Analysis, I did some projects for practice and experience. These are it.

**simple_statistics.xlsx** - This is a dataset of a company where the details are listed about the people who registered there for a particular post in a department of the company.
I used different formulas in excel and drew necessary conclusions about the company with visualizations (graphs and charts).

**case_study virtual_gaming_startup.xlsx** - This is a Revenue data dump for a gaming app for the month of April. The data dump contains the daily revenue collected from each user visiting
the app on each day of April. I used necessary excel formulas to analyse the data and answer some questions given in the attached sheet.

**Wine Review.ipynb** - This is a dataset about the review of different kinds of wines across the world. I used pandas to do data manipulation and answer the given questions.

**Loan Case Study.ipynb** - I applied exploratory data analysis on two datasets of previous applicants of loan and the current applicants of loan. This can be used for taking
actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending loan (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc...

**IPL Dataset.ipynb** - This contains two small dataframes of IPL17 and IPL18 (Indian Premier League) having the records of all the ipl teams that won the match, lost the match, etc..
I used pandas and numpy to answer some questions.

**IMDB Case Study.ipynb** - I did data analysis on the given dataset of movies.
